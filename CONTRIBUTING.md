ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Code Style

- Follow Go best practices
- Run `make fmt` before committing
- Ensure all linters pass with `make quality-check`
- Add comments for public functions and complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### QNAP-Specific Guidelines

- Test changes on actual QNAP hardware when possible
- Consider different QNAP models and QTS versions
- Handle CACHEDEV volume variations gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for QNAP-specific issues

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Integration Tests

If you have access to QNAP hardware:

```bash
NAS_HOST=your-qnap.local NAS_USER=admin make integration-test
```

### Quality Checks

```bash
make quality-check
```

This runs:
- `gofmt` - Code formatting
- `go vet` - Static analysis
- `staticcheck` - Advanced static analysis
- `ineffassign` - Ineffectual assignment detection
- `misspell` - Spelling mistakes
- `gocyclo` - Cyclomatic complexity
- `golint` - Go Report Card compliance

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. Run all checks:
   ```bash
   make clean && make all
   ```

3. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request on GitHub

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Quality checks pass
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (for significant changes)
- [ ] Tested on QNAP hardware (if possible)

## QNAP Testing Matrix
